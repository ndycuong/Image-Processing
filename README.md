 Each week each lesson in image processing.

  1. WEEK 1  : Display images, calculate Histogram, Gray scale changing and calculate Intensity profile
  2. WEEK 2  : Contrast enhance => Linear, non-lá»‰near transform and Image Interpolation
  3. WEEK 3  : Filters => Gaussian, Laplace, Median,.
  4. WEEK 4  : Fourier transform => high-pass and low-pass Gausian filters
  5. WEEK 5  : Image sharpening => Sobel, Laplace

Additionally, there are some bonus exercises in class by group project: Detect row and column from given chessboard images
